                                        This project was a technical test for an interview. It was a front end task focusing on HTML, javascript and CSS. The task was to create a stopwatch using HTML and vanilla Javascript.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I initially created ID elements in the HTML that I could target in the Javascript inside variables using the browser object model (BOM) ‘document.’ and the getElementByID method. Then create a function that has an ‘if’ statement that iterates through milliseconds, seconds, minutes and hours.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        After I had this in place I needed to outsource for some help. I used www.stackoverflow.com to get some advice and what I had was pretty close. I was advised to add ternary operators to the function. Using h1.textContent property to target HTML h1 tag contents.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I then created an onclick event handler for the start button called ‘start’ that invokes a function called timer() which then sets the t variable to setTimeout(add, 10). This starts the add() function.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Then another onclick event handler for the stop button which invokes an anonymous function that uses the clearTimeout() method that clears a timer set with the setTimeout() method.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Lastly one last onclick event handler for the clear button which invokes an anonymous function that resets the h1.textContent to ‘0’ also sets all the variables back to zero.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I styled the stopwatch program using vanilla css (no framework). I simply used HTML tags to center the DRO and buttons and used a linear gradient for the background colour. I used a hover pseudo class to add a hover effect to the buttons when the mouse hovers over it.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Although I needed some help to get this script to operate I feel that I learned along the way and feel that my Javascript skills increased. I needed to aim to spendapproximately 2 hours on this task. It took about three hours including a bit of planning out.
