                                        This is the second version of my portfolio website. I decided to update my old
                                        static site with Node.js, Express and Handlebars. The problem with the old
                                        version was that every time I wanted to add a new project to the portfolio
                                        section, I would have to add it to every page as a link in the navigational
                                        dropdown for mobile screen sizes. Now I had a considerable amount of projects
                                        that was becoming quite tedious.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I also wanted to cut down on repeated code. I used Node.js with a module called
                                        Express to create a base template, this encompassed the head, header and footer
                                        that was repeated on every page. I think this update probably cut the needed
                                        HTML down by half. I also used a npm module called Handlebars to eliminate the
                                        need to input data on every page, every time I wanted to add a new project. I
                                        placed a loop in the base template dropdown menu for portfolio projects. Now I
                                        only have to update the data in a Javascript object once. I did a similar thing
                                        for the list of education and work history elements on the resume page.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Overall I am pleased with this update. Looking back at the old site and
                                        comparing shows a significant improvement in my web development skills. I think
                                        I will try to update my personal website twice annually. It gives me a way to
                                        scale my skill level. In the next update I may implement SASS or a database.
